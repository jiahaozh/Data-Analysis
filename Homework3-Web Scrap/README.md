 ### Description:
 In this homework, I used web scraping to extract hotels' information in Booking.com.
 
 In the first part, I extracted all hotels' name, class of rating and rating score;
 
 And in the second part, I extracted all hotels' reviews' reviewer name, review data, review score, positive review 
 and negative review.
