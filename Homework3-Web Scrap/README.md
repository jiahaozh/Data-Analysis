 ### Description:
 In this homework, I used web scraping to extract hotels' information in Booking.com.
 
 In the first part, I extracted all hotels' name, class of rating and rating score; The output csv file is hotel_information.csv 
 
 And in the second part, I extracted all hotels' reviews' reviewer name, review data, review score, positive review 
 and negative review. Since the output csv file is over 50 Mb, I put the shared google drive link here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Xrbne1qRds0-TfhFxi43B0SexNqGAnB/view?usp=sharing
