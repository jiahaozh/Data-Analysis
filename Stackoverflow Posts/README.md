This is a homework to get you familiar with json objects, parsing large data, panda dataframes, xml objects and similarity metrics.
You will make requests to stackoverflow exchange and view/access the responses as json objects.
Then, you will parse a large dataset of stackoverflow exchange that is provided to you and information related to questions and answers.
Your information will be stored in a panda dataframe and will be used in order to plot the similarity between the top 100 users with the most answered questions.
